N2N (network to network)\cite{n2n_paper} is a layer-two over layer-three P2P virtual private network (VPN) application which allows users to exploit properties typical of P2P applications at the network level instead of application level. This means that users can gain unrestricted IP visibility and be reachable with the same address regardless of their current network environment. In a nutshell, as OpenVPN moved SSL \cite{tls} from application (e.g. used to implement the https protocol) to network protocol, N2N moves P2P from application to network level.

Like most P2P protocols, N2N has one or more supernodes and several edge nodes. Supernodes are used to introduce edge nodes and to cross symmetric NAT. Edge-nodes are grouped in communities coordinated by the supernode. Periodically an edge-node sends registration messages to supernode for keeping its record in the supernode peers list. A backup supernode can be assigned to each edge as a command line parameter which will be used if the connection with main supernode fails.
